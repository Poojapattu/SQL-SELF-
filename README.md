## 🚀 My SQL Learning Journey

### 🎓 Course-Based Learning
I began my journey with an incredible YouTube course taught by **SB Gowtham**, one of the most inspiring teachers I’ve come across.  
📺 [Watch the course here](https://youtu.be/JtaOmwnR6AM?si=LSufgbT5oCqK-4-5)

This course helped me:
- Understand **core DBMS concepts** (already part of my college syllabus).
- Gain **hands-on experience** through **real-world SQL use cases** like Zomato, Uber, and E-commerce datasets.
- Strengthen query writing using **joins, subqueries, window functions, and case statements**.

---

### 💪 Practice-Based Learning
After completing the course, I reinforced my skills through:
- 🧩 **LeetCode 75 SQL Challenge** – mastering query optimization, joins, aggregations, and ranking functions.
- 🌐 **Histablenotfound.com** – a gem for Tanglish learners (Tamil + English) where I continue practicing real-time queries and scenarios.
